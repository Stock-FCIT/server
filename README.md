Stock it's the first 

## About

App created in a group of people, everyone had different tasks, my first experience in writing backend. All backend written by myself.
In Stock-FCIT organisation You can check frontend code.

## Deployment

Due to free tier of render service, there can be problem with server's response, try to refresh page, or wait for 1-2 min.

Free tier does spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity, so the first request after the service is spun down make take a while, but subsequent requests should be faster.
